# football-commentary-app

This is a small proof-of-concept app which generates audible commentary based on unstructured football data.

To run it, you'll need to run 'npm run dev'. For it to function, you'll need to add a .env.local file to the root of the repo with API keys for OpenAI and ElevenLabs. You'll also need to add an env variable for the voice ID you want to use from ElevenLabs.
